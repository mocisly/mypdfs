\section{Main Theorems and Proofs}
Theorems not explicitly listed include Big List problems (4, 7, 10-12, 17, 19,
24, 28-32, 36), as well as all the various theorems and implications from the
``Definitions" and other projects. They have been omitted from this section to
avoid excess repetition.

Furthermore, theorems in the above list and theorems which come from handout
exercises have their proofs excluded, as they are on Piazza or in the
corresponding section. The proofs here are largely summaries of the proofs of all
the various parts on Piazza; some detail has been omitted for brevity.

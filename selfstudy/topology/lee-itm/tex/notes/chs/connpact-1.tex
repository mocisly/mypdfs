\subsection{Connectedness}
just gonna summarize things as usual

\begin{prop}
    connected iff no proper nonempty clopen subsets
\end{prop}

\begin{pf}[source=Primary Source Material]
    clopen separates space with its complement;
    conversely, components are clopen
\end{pf}

\begin{prop}
    $X$ nonempty connected.
    then every cts $f:X\sto Y$ w/ $Y$ discrete is constant
\end{prop}

\begin{pf}[source=Primary Source Material]
    $c = f(x)$ clopen so $f^{-1}(c)$ clopen
\end{pf}

\begin{prop}[type=Theorem]
    cts img of connected is connected
\end{prop}

\begin{pf}[source=Primary Source Material]
    contrapositive (contradiction, rly)
\end{pf}

\newpage
\begin{prop}
    \vspace{-0.275in}
    \begin{enumerate}[(\alph*)]
        \item $U,V\subseteq X$ open disjoint.
            if $A\subseteq U\cup V$ then $A\subseteq U$ or $A\subseteq V$
        \item dense connected subset implies connected
        \item $A\subseteq X$ connected then $A\subseteq B\subseteq \bar{A}$
            connected
        \item union of connected spaces w/ pt in common is connected
        \item finite prod of connected is connected
        \item quotient of connected is connected
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{pf}[source=Primary Source Material]
    \vspace{-0.275in}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $A\cap U, A\cap V$ disconnect $A$
        \item denote as $A$.
            by contradiction, $X=\bar{A}\subseteq \bar{U}=U$. supposedly.
        \item $A$ dense in $\bar{A}$
        \item follows from (a)
        \item by contradiction, fix $(a,b)\in U$.
            $\set{a}\times Y$ connected so in $U$.
            $X\times\set{y}$ connected for all $y$ and contains $(a,b)$,
            and their union is $X$.
        \item qmaps surj. and supposedly thats it
    \end{itemize}

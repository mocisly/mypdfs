\subsection{Some (Omitted) Preliminaries}

we're familiar w this; only new thing is the exterior, defined as the complement
of the closure. we use the convention that a neighbourhood is itself an open set

\begin{defn}
    Given two topologies $ \cl{T}_{1}, \cl{T}_{2} $, we say
    $ \mbf{\cl{T}_{1}} $ \textbf{is finer than} $ \mbf{\cl{T}_{2}} $ if
    $ \cl{T}_{2} \subseteq \cl{T}_{1} $. We define \textbf{coarser} analogously.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
    Let $ f:X \gto Y $ with arbitrary sets $ A \subseteq X, B \subseteq Y $.
    The following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $ f $ is continuous iff $ f(\bar{A}) \subseteq \bar{f(A)} $.
        \item $ f $ is closed iff $ \bar{f(A)} \subseteq f(\bar{A}) $.
        \item $ f $ is continuous iff $ f^{-1}(\sint(B)) \subseteq
            \sint(f^{-1}(B)) $.
        \item $ f $ is open iff $ \sint(f^{-1}(B)) \subseteq
            f^{-1}(\sint(B)) $
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

See Exercise ?? for proof.

\begin{defn}
    A map $ f:X \gto Y $ is a \textbf{local homeomorphism} if every point
    $ x \in X $ has a neighbourhood $ U $ such that $ f(U) \subseteq Y $ is open
    and homeomorphic to $ U $.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
    Some basic properties of local homeomorphisms follow:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Every homeomorphism is a local homeomorphism.
        \item Every local homeomorphism is continuous and open.
        \item Every bijective local homeomorphism is a homeomorphism.
    \end{itemize}
\end{prop}
